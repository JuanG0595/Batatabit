This is an experimental project in which mobile-first standard and responsive design were practised

This is an experimental project in which a mobile-first design standard was practised to create a Bitcoin interface application taking into account an important concept called responsive design. In this project, some other concepts like the use of relative and absolute measurements, CSS variables, the use of fonts uploaded in the head, the use of @media-queries, image resolutions and more were applied and worked.
